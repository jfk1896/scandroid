    <p>
      You must not misuse our Services.  You must not attempt to gain

      data or other proprietary material due to your access to or use of the
      Services or any third party content or websites.
    </p>

    <h3>About These Terms</h3>

    <p>
      These Terms and the VirusTotal Privacy Policy are the entire and
      exclusive agreement between VirusTotal and you regarding the Services
      (excluding any services for which you may have a separate agreement with
      VirusTotal that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms
      - e.g. premium private services), and these Terms supersede and replace
      any prior agreements between you and VirusTotal regarding the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that we may update and amend these Terms from time to time
      and any changes will be posted on the website. By continuing to access
      the Services after any changes become effective, you agree to be bound
      by the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The failure of VirusTotal to enforce any right or provision of these
      Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the
      event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
      unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in
      full force and effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection
      with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual
      disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of Ireland. The Irish courts will have exclusive
      jurisdiction over any claim arising from, or related to the Services
      although we retain the right to bring proceedings against you for breach
      of the Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country.
